                    From Ethiopia to the United States, the coffee bean has
                    had a long journey. The invigorating plant has been
                    consumed by humans for thousands of years, though 
                    not always in the form of a drink.

                    Read on to travel back
                    to the beginning of this ancient beverage.</pre>

                    Though several legends surround the origin of coffee, 
                    the most widely known features an Ethiopian goat 
                    herder named Kaldi. Living between 700 and 800 AD, 
                    Kaldi was tending to his goats when he noticed they had 
                    more energy than usual. He discovered that they’d been 
                    eating a plant with small red berries and, after trying the
                    fruit out himself, felt the same invigorating effects. 
                    Seeking guidance, he introduced the berries to monks at 
                    a nearby monastery, who enjoyed the burst of energy 
                    and began eating the fruit to improve their focus</pre>

                    Coffee eventually traveled to Yemen, via the port of 
                    Mocha. The drink became immensely popular in the region
                    of Arabia, and Muslims used it to facilitate staying awake 
                    during long nights of prayer. It even came to earn the 
                    nickname the “Wine of Araby,” as alcohol is forbidden.

                    Foreigners tried the drink while on pilgrimage to Mecca, 
                    enjoying sipping it in coffee houses. The governor of Mecca
                    eventually banned the drink, fearful of its stimulating effect, 
                    but after extensive protests and a decree from the Sultan, 
                    the ban was lifted.

                <pre>
                    Until the 17th century, coffee was grown almost 
                    exclusively in Arabia and Africa. However, an Indian 
                    man named Baba Budan carried fertile beans back to 
                    his home country after a pilgrimage and successfully 
                    grew the plant there. This was the beginning of the 
                    expansive coffee empire. 

                    In 1616, the Dutch established the first 
                    European-owned coffee plantation in Sri Lanka, and 
                    eventually expanded into Java, Indonesia as well. With 
                    European cultivation came European importation, and 
                    coffee arrived in Venice in 1570. Due to its bitter 
                    flavor and intoxicating effects, the drink initially 
                    received the same reaction it had earned from the 
                    governor of Mecca, earning itself the nickname “the 
                    devil’s cup.” Thankfully, Pope Clement VIII eventually 
                    tried coffee for himself and declared it to be a 
                    “Christian drink,” even going so far as to baptize it. 

                    Coffee’s popularity grew rapidly, expanding into Italy 
                    and France. The first British coffee house was 
                    established in 1652, inspired by those in Arabia, and 
                    others soon followed, becoming places of 
                    conversation and intellectual debate.

            <div class ="box14">
                <pre>
                    Coffee came to the Americas in the 18th century, with 
                    the Spanish cultivating it in Central America and the 
                    French establishing plantations in the Caribbean.
                    Brazilian Lieutenant Colonel Palheta obtained clippings 
                    of the plant from the French and began to grow coffee 
                    in his own country. This proved hugely successful, and 
                    Brazil remains the largest producer of coffee today.

                    The United States, on the other hand, is the leading 
                    importer of coffee. After the Boston Tea Party in 1773, 
                    Americans were encouraged to give up tea in favor of 
                    the more “patriotic” coffee for their morning beverage. 
                    As the drink’s popularity continued to grow, 
                    innovations came with it, including new ways of brewing 
                    and new entrepreneurs with methods of dispersing it 
                    across the country.

                <pre>
                    By the 1960s, a preference for specialty coffee was 
                    percolating. This led to the establishment of 
                    Starbucks in 1971. Likewise, some coffee sippers 
                    began to recognize a need for sustainable and 
                    responsible coffee production. The concept gave 
                    way to the “third wave” of coffee, which 
                    emphasizes quality, direct trade, and sustainability.

                    Responsibly sourced coffee is becoming 
                    increasingly popular. Built on standards of 
                    economic and environmental sustainability, as well 
                    as quality, this practice helps ensure farmers and 
                    workers are treated fairly, paid reasonable wages, 
                    enjoy safe working conditions, and are given 
                    opportunities for economic growth and 
                    development. Coffee drinkers can contribute to 
                    this sustainability by composting with coffee 
                    grounds, opting for low-waste brewing methods, 
                    and being conscious consumers.
